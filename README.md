# AtmoWEB
The Webinterface to visualise the output created by AtmoCL

## About
The Interface allows a more intuitive visualisation of the data generated by AtmoCL than the raw files would. Images can be played in sequence (arrow keys, space bar), time series and vertical profiles are plotted using [highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/).
We employ [boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to provide a (not quite finished!) mobile and desktop version.


## Installation
You need a running (Apache) webserver with php enabled. Simply clone the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/pSpitzner/AtmoWEB.git
```

Adjust the configuration file so that it finds the output from AtmoCL:
```
vi AtmoWEB/php/config.php
```
Make sure that the webserver has the correct access rights. You may also link the AtmoCL output folder to have the model dump its data in place that is suitable for your webserver.
